HALo CORE

[subhead] Connecting Enterprise Loyalty Everywhere

HALo CORE is the central set of tools that enables operators to configure and manage a single, centralized, card-based loyalty platform that integrates gaming and non-gaming spend across multiple systems. HALo CORE can be integrated with existing casino and property management systems, allowing you to leverage current technology investments without the need to standardize on new systems or platforms.

HALo CORE allows your loyalty club members to earn and redeem rewards based on spend from across your entire organization (including restaurants, spas, entertainment and retail in addition to gaming), and across multiple properties, integrated systems and touchpoints. It allows you to offer a consistent, enjoyable, and easy-to-use loyalty experience across all these platforms, and enables you to engage creatively with customers to boost affinity and gain a competitive edge.

HALo CORE offers great flexibility for managing your player loyalty program. It works with your content management system (CMS) to enhance, augment or replace your current marketing functionality for increased brand awareness and higher revenue. In addition, it can be decoupled from your existing CMS, enabling you to manage individual programs across gaming and non-gaming areas of your business.

HALo CORE allows operators to:

•	Operate a single card loyalty program locally or enterprise wide.
•	Extend brand loyalty across the enterprise by capturing and managing data, spend, promotions and comps beyond the casino floor.
•	Incentivize customers by earning and redeeming rewards from gaming and non-gaming spend.
•	Influence customer behavior by managing tiers based on spend across the entire organization, not just gaming.
